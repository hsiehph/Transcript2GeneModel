# Transcript2GeneModel
This is a simple snakemake pipeline to predict gene models from genomic DNA (FASTA sequences) using transcripts (i.e., this is a transcript-guided approach).

<b> Note, this pipeline will only work on the Eichler lab cluster due to dependencies </b>

To run this pipeline, the config.yaml must contain correct paths to the files for transcripts and FASTA sequences.
